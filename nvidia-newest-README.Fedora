README for Nvidia Linux Drivers, as packaged by livna.org.

1. After Installation
---------------------

You only have to restart X to start using the Nvidia drivers after
installation. Either choose "Log Out" from the GNOME/KDE menu, and then
press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace at the login prompt, or press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
directly. You should see a white screen with a big Nvidia logo in the middle
for about one second.

To check that hardware acceleration is working, issue the following command
in a terminal:

        glxinfo | grep "OpenGL vendor"

That should print out

        OpenGL vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation

Also, the command

        glxinfo | grep direct

should print out

        direct rendering: Yes

If it does, you're all set.

2. Basic Configuration
----------------------

The installation scripts perform the basic configuration for you.
When (if) you uninstall the drivers, the configuration is reset to
use the X.org/XFree86 Nvidia drivers again. If you want to temporarily
disable the Nvidia drivers without uninstalling, you can issue the
following two commands as root (remember su -):

        nvidia-newest-config-display disable

To re-enable the Nvidia drivers, run:

        nvidia-newest-config-display enable


3. Additional configuration
---------------------------

It's possible to configure image quality and performance by setting various
environment variables. Take a look at /etc/profile.d/nvidia.sh
(or .csh if you use csh) and read the README file in the same directory
as this file.

There are a number of settings in the X configuration file as well.
The most interesting are acceleration of the XRENDER extension and AGP
configuration. In the Driver section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf, you may add
the following line:

        Option "RenderAccel" "true"

to enable XRENDER acceleration. A value of "false" disables it.
Note: this has shown to make some systems unstable, making the display freeze.
If you experience this, set to "false" or comment out the line.

To control AGP behaviour, add the following line to the Driver section:

        Option "NvAGP" "X"

where X is 0, 1, 2 or 3. The different values are as follows (from Nvidia
README):

        0 : disable agp
        1 : use NVIDIA's internal AGP support, if possible
        2 : use AGPGART, if possible
        3 : use any agp support (try AGPGART, then NVIDIA's AGP)

Default is 3. AGPGART is the Linux kernel AGP driver. See Nvidia README,
appendix D for more information. AGP speed is controlled by giving a parameter
to the Nvidia kernel module, but should be autodetected in most cases.
See output of "modinfo nvidia".

For more configuration options (TwinView, TV-out etc) see the Nvidia README.

4. An Initscript to enable/disable nvidia driver
------------------------------------------------

To make gdm work at system start this package contains an initscript that
will be run during start up. This script will detect if the nvidia module
for the running kernel is present. If the module is present, then the
initscript will run.

        "nvidia-newest-config-display enable"

so that the X server will use the nvidia driver, otherwise it will run

        "nvidia-newest-config-display disable"

and X will use the nv driver. You can disable this check by running, as
root (with root $PATH) :

        chkconfig nvidia-newest off


This script will also be invoked when switching to runlevels 6
(reboot) and 0 (halt). When rebooting (or shutting down) the system,
the script will _disable_ nvidia driver (and switch back to "nv"
driver), so that, whatever the kernel you boot, Red Hat Graphical Boot
will work.

We suggest you read the chkconfig(8) man page for complete
informations about how to handle rc scripts.
